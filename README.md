# Chat Us

This is a simple real-time chat application using Maven.

### Used technology:
- SpringBoot for backend.
- React.js for frontend.

First, the server is setup in Spring Boot and then connected with a client written in React.

Spring Boot and React are used to send messages to the server, and anyone who connects will see those messages in their browser in real-time.
Used websocket to chat.
